paperClip utilises the VADAR Sentiment Analysis Python libarary, extracting tweets via the Twitter Api which is powered by a Flask application. VADAR sentiment categorises textual data into sentiment categories: Positive, Negative & Neutral. 


Although this library is synonymous in the field of machine learning language processeing, it is important to note its limitations which include the modelling's susceptability to sarcasm, jargon & the general variance of human dialect & language. At this stage, machine's are unable to 100% accurately understand human emotion from text, however this technology continues to be developed.
